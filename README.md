My minimalist Arch Linux configuration with the focus on productivity and usability, featuring:
- window manager: Swayfx
- bar: Swaybar
- switcher: Wofi
- terminal emulator: Alacritty

Key config aspects include:
- crucial optimisations for 60% keyboard,
- left-handed trackball config,
- low contrast colorschemes - easy on the eyes,
- Swayfx for nice, clean, minimal blur and shadow effects.
