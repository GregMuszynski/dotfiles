My minimalist Arch Linux configuration with the focus on productivity and usability, featuring:
- window manager: i3
- compositor: Picom
- bar: Polybar
- switcher: Rofi
- terminal emulator: Alacritty

Key config aspects include:
- crucial key combinations and shortcuts for 60% keyboard,
- left-handed trackball config,
- low contrast colorschemes - easy on the eyes,
- Picom for clean, minimal blur and shadow effects.
